# Canvas v2 (official canvas) — dev notes

Working notes for the hybrid-shell migration: the editor keeps every existing
surface (header, action panels, queue bar, NodeDetailModal, connection mode)
and swaps only the canvas for the official ComfyUI frontend embedded in an
iframe. Custom-node frontend extensions load natively inside the iframe, which
is the whole point of the migration.

Status: first slice merged on `feat/canvas-v2-official-canvas` (2026-07-20),
verified end-to-end in-browser on macOS.

Gateway migration status: this experimental canvas is disabled by default.
`CanvasHost` still expects the official ComfyUI frontend at the configured
server root, while the Gateway root now serves Comfy Mobile itself and does
not proxy arbitrary frontend assets. A namespaced, authenticated upstream
frontend route (or packaged official frontend assets) is required before this
mode can be enabled in the Android/Gateway architecture. Do not bypass the
Gateway by pointing a release client at `8188` as a workaround.

## Architecture

```
WorkflowEditor
├─ officialCanvasEnabled? (canvasV2Store, persisted; "Official canvas β" chip)
│   ├─ true  → CanvasHost (src/components/canvas-v2/CanvasHost.tsx)
│   │          iframe → official FE (server /) + bridge extension inside it
│   └─ false → WorkflowCanvas (legacy custom renderer, unchanged)
├─ NodeDetailModal / connection mode / QuickActionPanel … (unchanged)
```

- **Bridge extension** `comfy-mobile-ui-api-extension/fe/mobileBridge.js`
  (served via `WEB_DIRECTORY = "fe"`). Loaded by the official FE like any
  custom-node extension; activates only inside an iframe (or `?mobileBridge=1`
  for direct debugging). The ONLY code coupled to FE internals — keep it that
  way. Hides desktop chrome via injected CSS (selectors verified on FE 1.48).
- **Shell client** `src/services/bridge/CanvasBridgeClient.ts` — typed
  postMessage channel (protocol v1, `src/shared/types/bridge.ts`): events,
  fire-and-forget commands, request/response with correlation ids.
  `getActiveCanvasBridge()` is the registry cross-cutting code uses to mirror
  edits without prop drilling.
- **Dual-graph mirror strategy**: the editor still loads the workflow into its
  own ComfyGraph (UI model — modal & panels work unchanged). Edits mirror into
  the official graph live (`useWidgetValueEditor` taps + node-mode handlers).
  Execution serializes via the official `graphToPrompt` (bridge `get-prompt` →
  existing `executeWorkflow`, so tracking/WS progress is unchanged). Save
  serializes via the official graph (`get-workflow` → IndexedDB), preserving
  positions/links changed directly on the canvas.
- **Session-restore race**: the FE asynchronously restores its own last
  workflow after startup and can overwrite the shell's `load-workflow`. The
  bridge delays `bridge-ready` until the first `afterConfigureGraph` (or 1.5s
  grace) and reasserts the shell's workflow if an external configure replaces
  it. Don't remove this without re-testing reload persistence.

## Verified end-to-end

Import from server → open editor → toggle β → node select → NodeDetailModal
(with metadata) → widget edit mirrors live onto the official canvas → save →
IndexedDB holds the official serialization → reload restores it. Missing-model
highlights render natively on the canvas.

## Strategy update (2nd slice)

Official-canvas mode is now a PURE official editing surface: the FE owns all
canvas interaction (selection, wiring validity, moves, on-canvas widget
edits) — no selection→modal routing, no legacy mirrors of interactions, and
the right action rail is hidden (queue bar stays). The shell only tracks
dirtiness — the bridge fingerprint now covers widget values too — shows a
Save button, and persists via `get-workflow` (rebuilding the legacy graph
model on save). Switching canvas modes auto-saves pending edits on either
side, so both canvases always resume from the same workflow JSON. Bridge
files are served with `Cache-Control: no-cache` (partitioned browser caches
made stale bridge modules unrecoverable client-side). This supersedes the
earlier connection/reposition-mode rewiring plan — deleted from the backlog.

## Known issues / not yet done

1. ~~Structural edits made on the official canvas reach the editor only via
   save~~ → DONE: the bridge polls a graph fingerprint (nodes/links/pos/mode;
   litegraph fires no hook for node moves) and emits a debounced
   `graph-mutated` once changes settle; the editor pulls `get-workflow` and
   rebuilds its ComfyGraph through the session store (`syncWorkflow`), keeping
   NodeDetailModal/selection fresh. Verified: mode change via bridge →
   exactly one event → resync without errors.
2. Connection mode / reposition mode still operate on the legacy graph only —
   need bridge commands (`connect`, `disconnect`, `set-node-pos`) and rewiring
   of their apply paths.
3. FE top-right notification card ("View details") is still visible in embeds;
   add its selector to the bridge CSS.
4. postMessage targetOrigin is `'*'` in the bridge (shell side already
   origin-checks). Lock to the shell origin before shipping.
5. Subgraph sessions: the shell always loads the ROOT workflow into the iframe.
6. Real queue execution over the v2 path (`get-prompt`) not yet run on a
   machine with the models present.
7. `/canvas-lab` route is the original plumbing experiment — keep for
   debugging, delete before release.

## Legacy bridge-only dev setup

The following direct-ComfyUI setup is retained only for isolated browser
development of the experimental bridge. It is not the supported Gateway or
Android deployment path. Link the extension into ComfyUI, install its Python
dependencies (`aiofiles` is the critical one), restart ComfyUI with
`--enable-cors-header`, then run `npm run dev` and connect the browser harness
directly to the ComfyUI URL.

- macOS: `ln -s <repo>/comfy-mobile-ui-api-extension ~/ComfyUI/custom_nodes/`
- Windows (no admin needed):
  `mklink /J C:\...\ComfyUI\custom_nodes\comfy-mobile-ui-api-extension C:\...\comfy-mobile-ui\comfy-mobile-ui-api-extension`

Bridge JS edits apply on page refresh; `__init__.py` changes need a server
restart. Sanity checks: `/comfymobile/api/status` returns JSON and
`/extensions/comfy-mobile-ui-api-extension/mobileBridge.js` is served.

Note: automated browsers cannot click inside the cross-origin iframe (real
input works fine). For scripted testing, drive selection via
`iframe.contentWindow.postMessage({source:'comfy-mobile-shell',
type:'select-node', payload:{nodeId}}, '*')`, and prefer running the server
without `--multi-user` so the iframe skips the user-select screen.
